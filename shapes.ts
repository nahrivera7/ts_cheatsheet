// If we try to store a Student as a Person, it doesn't throw any error,
// because TypeScript assumes that every Student is a Person (because the class Student extends the class Person)
newPerson = newStudent

// But if we try to do the opposite, it will throw an error ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤¬
// becase a Person is not necessarily a Student, can be a Teacher for example.
// So TypeScript show us that the property 'enroll' is missing in the variable newPerson, which is true:
newStudent = newPerson
